# Age-Finder
After watching a tik tok video that showed a guy calculating someoneâ€™s ages based on their shoe size and date of birth. I created a simple python code to do the same thing.

You enter your age, and then two zeros are added by multiplying your age X 100 , this is stored in a variable (age x100).

The program will then ask for your birth year, and then it will do a calculation and display a number, where the last two digits would be your age or the age you will be in 2020.
